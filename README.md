# Using Laravel-mix with Electron APP 


This app can be used as a starting point for you if you want to build a desktop app using electron.
It is backed with:
1. [Laravel-mix](https://laravel-mix.com).
2. [Vuejs](http://vuejs.org/)
3. [Electron build](https://www.electron.build)

By default it will skip signing your mac application.


## NOTE:

This is still a **work in progress** which means you may face some problems, it would be nice to share it with us.
